<p>You may have come across some of this before, but I wanted to write this down for some future reference because it came up in a project of mine and I want to refer to it later. The general theme is that if you know something about the structure of the matrices you’re working with, you can <em>sometimes</em> speed some things up.</p>
<div id="avoiding-matrix-inversion." class="section level2">
<h2>Avoiding matrix inversion.</h2>
<p>Why do you want to invert your matrix? Usually you do not want to directly inspect the thing, you want to find <span class="math inline">\(A^{-1}B\)</span>. <code>solve(A)</code> is slow - if you only have to do it once, don’t bother optimizing this. If you have to do it millions of times (MCMC sampling from multivariate distributions tends to require inversion of a matrix and millions of samples), it makes sense to think about this.</p>
<p>Finding <span class="math inline">\(A^{-1}B\)</span> is equivalent to finding <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(B = Ax\)</span>. There are a few different ways to do this. The only way to know which is better in your situation is to profile your code and benchmark it. Some bright ideas don’t actually help.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(20180212)
library(microbenchmark)
A &lt;- rWishart(n = 1, df = 15, Sigma = diag(10))[,,1]
B &lt;- rWishart(n = 1, df = 15, Sigma = diag(10))[,,1]
invbench &lt;- microbenchmark(
  solve(A) %*% B,
  solve(A, B),
  qr.solve(A,B),
  times = 1e4
)
print(invbench)</code></pre>

<p>These results are not particularly inspiring - however, there are other options, especially if you need other information about your matrix later! Use <code>solve(A,B)</code> but don’t lose sleep over it if this is all you know about your matrix.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploit-the-structure-of-your-matrix." class="section level2">
<h2>Exploit the structure of your matrix.</h2>
<p>If you know something about the structure of your matrix, there may be more appropriate methods that are faster. It’s helpful to page through a brief description of linear algebra routines available to give some ideas. Symmetric matrices, diagonal matrices, banded matrices, etc. A covariance matrix is symmetric and positive definite, this makes some things easy. And as statisticians, we are very often dealing with covariance matrices! For instance, eigenvalue calculation:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>eigenbench &lt;- microbenchmark(
  eigen(A),
  eigen(A, symmetric = TRUE),
  times = 1e4
) 
eigenA &lt;- eigen(A)
print(eigenbench)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Unit: microseconds
                       expr     min       lq      mean    median        uq
                   eigen(A) 800.076 927.7615 1323.9898 1096.4740 1154.0985
 eigen(A, symmetric = TRUE) 173.771 203.3245  293.7342  247.1535  273.2655
      max neval

<pre class="r"><code>plot(eigenbench, log = &quot;y&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-02-12-some-linear-algebra-tricks_files/figure-html/eigen-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I noticed this when I was profiling my code for something that did, unfortunately, require both eigenvalues and matrix inversion. <code>profvis</code> indicated <code>eigen()</code> was a big drag on my speed, but when I drilled down, I saw much of it was spent on <code>isSymmetric()</code> (verify yourself, R Studio makes it easy!). My input was a covariance matrix so it was guaranteed to be symmetric. Reading the helpful manual page, I saw that the argument can be provided. Unfortunately, reading the source code, they drop down into C to compute the eigenvalues, so there isn’t an additional chance for speedup there.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the first example: we are dealing with a covariance matrix, so there are other ideas besides (the disastrous) <code>qr.solve</code> available.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cholinv &lt;- microbenchmark(
  solve(A, B), # worked best last time
  solve(A) %*% B,
  chol2inv(chol(A)) %*% B, 
  times = 1e4

print(cholinv)</code></pre>

<div id="reuse-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Reuse information</h2>
<p>Nothing above really stood out, except what we learned before. Calculating the Cholesky decomposition is on the same order of complexity as solving and ends up having about the same runtime - it’s slightly better, but nothing to write home about. However, suppose for some reason you already have the Cholesky decomposition (note: always check notation - some people use the term for <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(LL^T = X\)</span> and some use it for <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(R^T R = X\)</span> - which does <code>R</code> use?).</p>

<p>There is a similar idea if you already happen to have the results of <code>eigen()</code> on hand. Cutting time in half is a decent result.</p>
</div>
<div id="determinants" class="section level2">
<h2>Determinants</h2>
<p>One good reason to have a Cholesky decomposition or eigenvalue decomposition on hand
(besides the fun of it) is to avoid computing a determinant, which comes up in densities
all the time. Again, since we’re looking at a covariance matrix, there are ways around
direct computation. Both of these are unfortunately of the same order of complexity as
computing a determinant but slightly faster. However, if you need a determinant,
you just might also need the eigenvalues or the Cholesky decomposition or an inverse.
If that is the case, what were once modest gains in speed become big savings.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>detbenchmark &lt;- microbenchmark(
  det(A),
  prod(diag((chol(A))))^2,
  prod(diag(C))^2, # C = chol(A)
  prod(eigen(A, symmetric = TRUE)$values),
  prod(eigenA$values) # eigenA = eigen(A)
)
print(detbenchmark)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Unit: microseconds
                                    expr     min       lq      mean
                                  det(A)  32.682  38.3810  53.52603

                         prod(diag(C))^2   9.312  11.3220  15.09580

<p>Again, we see that while performing a decomposition just for the sake of computing something faster may not be worth it, it’s worth keeping in mind that if you need multiple things, doing so may be much faster, and if you need one of these anyway, keep the result and use it for the others. These will also vary based on your use cases, so profiling is the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-brought-this-up" class="section level2">
<h2>What brought this up</h2>
<p>A project where I needed Cholesky decompositions, inverses, and sometimes even determinants or eigenvalues as well. I’m not trying to be fast, but it’s nice to not be terribly slow. Again, if you don’t need more than one of the above, don’t bother! Wasting developer time is rarely worth it. If you have more specialized needs, of course, there are other tools for that.</p>
<p>NB: of course you want to validate that you get the same answers and if applicable add them as test cases in your computations.</p>
