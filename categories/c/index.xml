      <description>or: adventures with .Call Generally I work either in R or in C but not both. My research is trying to do some big things faster and there’s existing code in C that I’m working with. I might dump some output and then explore it in R, but I don’t need to interface between them. On the other hand, when consulting with others it’s going to come down to good old-fashioned statistics so that happens in R (or SAS if applicable, for some things it’s better and for some things the people you’re working with are using SAS).</description>
