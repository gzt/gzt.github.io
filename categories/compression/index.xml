      <description>I recently gave a talk at TADS about one of my old projects - it&amp;rsquo;s not my best idea but I did put a fair bit of work into it. In the future, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about one of my good ideas! The audio/video may be available soon. I will update this post when they are if you really want it, but the talks are somewhat informal.
