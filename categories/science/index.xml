      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce a new paper in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, Quantitative matching of forensic evidence fragments utilizing 3D microscopy analysis of fracture surface replicas, which extends our prior work on fracture matching. Here we show that the method works when, instead of matching two fracture surfaces directly, we instead use replicas, which is common in forensic applications.</description>

      <description>As scientists, we have ethical responsibilities related to the uses of our work, and sometimes these are not entirely obvious. We have to at least pretend to think about them. If our work is “basic” research, we can claim moral ambiguity sometimes (whether such claims are justified is an empirical question). If our work is “applied”, we have little cover.
When I read articles about uncritical applications of “machine learning” to “social issues”, I just can’t handle it.</description>
