    <h1 class="article-title">About</h1>

    

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I&rsquo;m Geoff Thompson, a Visiting Assistant Professor at Indiana University.
I have a PhD from Iowa State University (2021). My research interests are in clustering
and other classification problems as well as unsupervised or semisupervised learning.
I have also worked in the statistical consulting group at Iowa State University and Indiana University in addition to my research.
You can see my software on my <a href="https://github.com/gzt">github</a> and, below,
in my list of projects, you can see some of the work I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>But, generally, a lot of aspects of going from large messy real-world data
to the truth of what is going on. I work mostly on the &ldquo;Model&rdquo; part of
the &ldquo;Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data&rdquo; formulation of Data Science.
The applications have mostly been image-related (forensics and medical imaging), but I don&rsquo;t care what things
<em>look</em> like. I also enjoyed working with the statistical consulting group
for a couple years, since other people&rsquo;s problems are more interesting than my own;
I get to work on the interesting statistics and learn a little about a new field<br>
then they get to do the
hard work of finishing the project and writing &ndash; after we make sure we both understand it. For a moment, you feel like an expert
in a completely foreign field.</p>
<p>I also like long walks on the beach.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2019.1696208?journalCode=ucgs20">Forensic matching of knife fragments using matrix variate discriminant analysis</a> and some other applications of matrix variate discriminant analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MixMatrix</code> an R package for working with matrix variate distributions such as the matrix variate normal or matrix variate <em>t</em>-distribution performing discriminant analysis and clustering. On <a href="https://www.github.com/gzt/MixMatrix">github</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=MixMatrix">CRAN</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CholWishart</code> an R package for some distributions and functions related to the Wishart, in particular sampling from the Cholesky factorization of the Wishart and inverse Wishart. On <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=CholWishart">CRAN</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/gzt/CholWishart">github</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Porting <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6402">scalable <em>k</em>-means++</a> (or <em>k</em>-means||) to OpenMPI (a minor work).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://www.github.com/gzt/replaceR">small C program</a> to replace the use of the Rmath standalone library for random  number generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CatSIM, a <a href="https://www.github.com/gzt/catsim">similarity metric</a> for binomial and multinomial image comparison accounting for structural similarity, after the model of the MS-SSIM metric. See on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09073">Arxiv</a> and on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=catsim">CRAN</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In progress: <a href="https://github.com/gzt/rNFFT/">rNFFT</a>, an R wrapper for the NFFT library (nonequispaced nodes Fast Fourier Transform). There are a lot of functions in the NFFT library. What I have works, though it
doesn&rsquo;t save and re-use &ldquo;plans&rdquo;, which would make it more useful. If I had an application for it
other than the radon and inverse radon transform, I would revisit it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In progress: a parallelization of Hartigan and Wong&rsquo;s k-means algorithm for OpenMPI. This was
the third chapter of my dissertation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In progress: a clustering-based image compression algorithm - see the 2014 award. This was the first chapter of my dissertation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In progress: multinomial clustering with covariates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In progress: even more.</p>
