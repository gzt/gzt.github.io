      <description>I recently had an issue where I wanted to plot a line connecting the monotonically increasing part of some subset of the data. So I figured I would try to make my own ggplot2 layer to do it.
It’s actually pretty straightforward! The first step is to read the documentation for extending ggplot2. A helpful quote if you ever have impostor syndrome:
 As you read this document, you’ll see many things that will make you scratch your head and wonder why on earth is it designed this way?</description>

      <description>Nobody cares what I think, of course. The grammar of graphics is The Way, and ggplot2 is my preferred method of visualization. I never even really tried to make my own graphs with base plot until some point last fall (so: after 5 years of R) - I mean, I’m at Iowa State, after all. I don’t hang out with our Graphics Group as much as I should but that’s how I think about plotting.</description>
