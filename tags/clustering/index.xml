      <description>I was one of the winners of the 2021 student paper competition for the ASA Section on Statistics in Imaging. You can see a version of the submitted paper, but substantial edits have been made in response to reviewer feedback in the time between the submission to the competition and the talk.
 We introduce CatSIM, a new similarity metric for binary and multinary two- and three-dimensional images and volumes. CatSIM uses a structural similarity image quality paradigm and is robust to small perturbations in location so that structures in similar, but not entirely overlapping, regions of two images are rated higher than using simple matching.</description>

      <description>I recently gave a talk at TADS about one of my old projects - it&amp;rsquo;s not my best idea but I did put a fair bit of work into it. In the future, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about one of my good ideas! The audio/video may be available soon. I will update this post when they are if you really want it, but the talks are somewhat informal.
