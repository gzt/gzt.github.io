      <title>Great News! I fixed my web-log</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t successfully published a post in a while but I finally fixed my web-log and pushed out some old posts today. I had several issues (putting notes here so I can fix again later):
 A recent issue, but R Studio was not working on my main computer (Fedora with XFCE). I often use Emacs+ESS, but for things like the blogdown, it is just easier to use R Studio and its add-ins.</description>

      <title>Plotting a Monotonic Increasing Sequence</title>

      <description>I recently had an issue where I wanted to plot a line connecting the monotonically increasing part of some subset of the data. So I figured I would try to make my own ggplot2 layer to do it.
It’s actually pretty straightforward! The first step is to read the documentation for extending ggplot2. A helpful quote if you ever have impostor syndrome:
 As you read this document, you’ll see many things that will make you scratch your head and wonder why on earth is it designed this way?</description>

      <title>The R Uncoast Unconference</title>

      <description>Last week, I participated in the Uncoast Unconference, which was a great opportunity to catch up with some old colleagues, meet a bunch of new people, and collaborate on some interesting projects.
The way these unconferences work, if you’re not familiar (I wasn’t, it was my first), is that people get together and decide on some project to work on (which can, hopefully, be finished in two days). Experience levels range from complete beginners to R Core contributors.</description>

      <title>Know your PRNGs</title>

      <description>TL;DR version: if all you&amp;rsquo;re using the standalone R math library in C for is generating uniform random numbers, I have a little C program to remove that dependency as long as you don&amp;rsquo;t mind your seeds not having the same output as R. I might even fix that later.
I fell into a rabbit hole recently - I do a fair amount of work in C using the R standalone math library for pseudo-random number generation (PRNGs) and sometimes some of its special functions (rather than, say, working in C so it will be called from R or trying to implement a PRNG myself or a special function myself - leave RNGs and numerical analysis to experts).</description>

      <title>A Quick Note about rInvWishart in CholWishart</title>

      <description>People wanting to simulate from the inverse Wishart may want their inverses to be the exact inverses of what are generated by rWishart or may be wondering about how, exactly, rInvWishart is parameterized. You might expect that simulating from rWishart with a covariance matrix Sigma gives results related to simulating from rInvWishart with covariance Sigma or you might want it with covariance Sigma^(-1). So which is it?

      <title>Quick Checks of Your Simulated Distributions</title>
      <link>/2019/01/09/verifying-your-simulations/</link>

      <guid>/2019/01/09/verifying-your-simulations/</guid>
      <description>I’ve written a couple packages for simulating from some distributions (Wishart-related distributions in CholWishart and matrix-variate distributions in matrixdist) and sometimes when a new function has been written or has been refactored, you need some ways to verify it is giving the answers you expect. There is an entire literature on this in general, but I am going to discuss one handy trick I sometimes use if there isn’t much theory to rely on or if you just want some quick heuristic to show you are in the right ballpark.</description>

      <title>New Version of CholWishart Released</title>
      <link>/2019/01/08/new-version-of-cholwishart-released/</link>

      <guid>/2019/01/08/new-version-of-cholwishart-released/</guid>
      <description>I have just released version 0.9.4 of CholWishart. If you want to simulate from the inverse Wishart, compute densities for the Wishart or inverse Wishart, or use the multivariate gamma or digamma function, this is the R package for you. It has a few other functions (notably, its namesake which generates random samples from the Wishart distribution and returns their Cholesky decomposition).
New in this release: the pseudo Wishart and its pseudo-inverse, the generalized inverse Wishart.</description>

      <title>Notes on Discriminant Analysis for Matrix Variate Distributions</title>

      <description>I have some brief notes for a discussion here so I’m posting them even though they’re a little incomplete because why not? Two-class classification for matrix variate normal distributions.
Expected Cost of Misclassification ECM is expected cost of misclassification. Suppose there are two populations, \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\) with prior probabilities of belonging to these classes, \(p_1\) and \(p_2\). Define a function, \(c(1|2)\) as the cost of misclassifying a member of population \(\pi_2\) as a member of class \(1\) (and vice versa).</description>

      <description>I have just finished setting up handling for AR(1) and compound symmetry variance structures in my maximum likelihood estimation function for matrix variate normal distributions in matrixdist. This means I may submit it to CRAN soon (it’s currently available on github). An example:
library(MixMatrix) A &amp;lt;- rmatrixnorm(100, mean=array(0,dim=c(3,4)), U = toeplitz(c(1,.8,.64)), V = rWishart(1,7,diag(4))[,,1]) MLmatrixnorm(A, row.variance=&amp;quot;AR(1)&amp;quot;) $mean [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 0.2993834 0.05670813 0.4119235 0.2035769 [2,] 0.3010836 0.06080098 0.</description>

      <title>why I&#39;ve been using base plot</title>

      <description>Nobody cares what I think, of course. The grammar of graphics is The Way, and ggplot2 is my preferred method of visualization. I never even really tried to make my own graphs with base plot until some point last fall (so: after 5 years of R) - I mean, I’m at Iowa State, after all. I don’t hang out with our Graphics Group as much as I should but that’s how I think about plotting.</description>

      <description>or: adventures with .Call Generally I work either in R or in C but not both. My research is trying to do some big things faster and there’s existing code in C that I’m working with. I might dump some output and then explore it in R, but I don’t need to interface between them. On the other hand, when consulting with others it’s going to come down to good old-fashioned statistics so that happens in R (or SAS if applicable, for some things it’s better and for some things the people you’re working with are using SAS).</description>

      <description>You may have come across some of this before, but I wanted to write this down for some future reference because it came up in a project of mine and I want to refer to it later. The general theme is that if you know something about the structure of the matrices you’re working with, you can sometimes speed some things up.
Avoiding matrix inversion. Why do you want to invert your matrix?</description>
