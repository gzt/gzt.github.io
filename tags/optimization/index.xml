      <description>or: adventures with .Call Generally I work either in R or in C but not both. My research is trying to do some big things faster and there’s existing code in C that I’m working with. I might dump some output and then explore it in R, but I don’t need to interface between them. On the other hand, when consulting with others it’s going to come down to good old-fashioned statistics so that happens in R (or SAS if applicable, for some things it’s better and for some things the people you’re working with are using SAS).</description>

      <description>You may have come across some of this before, but I wanted to write this down for some future reference because it came up in a project of mine and I want to refer to it later. The general theme is that if you know something about the structure of the matrices you’re working with, you can sometimes speed some things up.
Avoiding matrix inversion. Why do you want to invert your matrix?</description>
