      <description>I’ve written a couple packages for simulating from some distributions (Wishart-related distributions in CholWishart and matrix-variate distributions in matrixdist) and sometimes when a new function has been written or has been refactored, you need some ways to verify it is giving the answers you expect. There is an entire literature on this in general, but I am going to discuss one handy trick I sometimes use if there isn’t much theory to rely on or if you just want some quick heuristic to show you are in the right ballpark.</description>

      <title>New Version of CholWishart Released</title>

      <description>I have just released version 0.9.4 of CholWishart. If you want to simulate from the inverse Wishart, compute densities for the Wishart or inverse Wishart, or use the multivariate gamma or digamma function, this is the R package for you. It has a few other functions (notably, its namesake which generates random samples from the Wishart distribution and returns their Cholesky decomposition).
New in this release: the pseudo Wishart and its pseudo-inverse, the generalized inverse Wishart.</description>
