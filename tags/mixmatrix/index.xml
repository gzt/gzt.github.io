      <description>In the previous post, I had some rough notes on classification of matrix variate data. In the matrixdist package, I now have some functions for training a linear or quadratic classifier. The usage is pretty similar to the function MASS::lda() or MASS::qda(), however it requires the input as an array or list of matrices and the group variable provided as a vector (that is, it cannot handle data frames or the formula interface directly, which is reasonable, as there is no immediately clear way to make that work for a collection of matrices - anybody using it would have to roll their own solutions anyway).</description>
