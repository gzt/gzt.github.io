      <description>TL;DR version: if all you&amp;rsquo;re using the standalone R math library in C for is generating uniform random numbers, I have a little C program to remove that dependency as long as you don&amp;rsquo;t mind your seeds not having the same output as R. I might even fix that later.
I fell into a rabbit hole recently - I do a fair amount of work in C using the R standalone math library for pseudo-random number generation (PRNGs) and sometimes some of its special functions (rather than, say, working in C so it will be called from R or trying to implement a PRNG myself or a special function myself - leave RNGs and numerical analysis to experts).</description>
