      <description>Last week, I participated in the Uncoast Unconference, which was a great opportunity to catch up with some old colleagues, meet a bunch of new people, and collaborate on some interesting projects.
The way these unconferences work, if you’re not familiar (I wasn’t, it was my first), is that people get together and decide on some project to work on (which can, hopefully, be finished in two days). Experience levels range from complete beginners to R Core contributors.</description>
