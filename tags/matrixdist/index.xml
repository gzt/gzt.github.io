      <description>Or even with other functions in the same package? With a set seed, one would expect the random draws from two equivalent distributions to be the same.
library(&amp;#39;matrixdist&amp;#39;) set.seed(20180223) rmatrixnorm(n = 1, mean = matrix(0, nrow = 1, ncol = 5), array = T) ## , , 1 ## ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1.153053 -0.08006347 1.040504 0.9671611 -0.002402098 set.seed(20180223) rmatrixnorm(n = 1, mean = matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 1), array = T) ## , , 1 ## ## [,1] ## [1,] 1.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I had some rough notes on classification of matrix variate data. In the matrixdist package, I now have some functions for training a linear or quadratic classifier. The usage is pretty similar to the function MASS::lda() or MASS::qda(), however it requires the input as an array or list of matrices and the group variable provided as a vector (that is, it cannot handle data frames or the formula interface directly, which is reasonable, as there is no immediately clear way to make that work for a collection of matrices - anybody using it would have to roll their own solutions anyway).</description>

      <description>I have some brief notes for a discussion here so I’m posting them even though they’re a little incomplete because why not? Two-class classification for matrix variate normal distributions.
Expected Cost of Misclassification ECM is expected cost of misclassification. Suppose there are two populations, \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\) with prior probabilities of belonging to these classes, \(p_1\) and \(p_2\). Define a function, \(c(1|2)\) as the cost of misclassifying a member of population \(\pi_2\) as a member of class \(1\) (and vice versa).</description>

      <description>I have just finished setting up handling for AR(1) and compound symmetry variance structures in my maximum likelihood estimation function for matrix variate normal distributions in matrixdist. This means I may submit it to CRAN soon (it’s currently available on github). An example:
library(matrixdist) A &amp;lt;- rmatrixnorm(100, mean=array(0,dim=c(3,4)), U = toeplitz(c(1,.8,.64)), V = rWishart(1,7,diag(4))[,,1]) MLmatrixnorm(A, row.variance=&amp;quot;AR(1)&amp;quot;) $mean [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] -0.14927218 0.14837747 -0.12314591 0.2203576 [2,] 0.03791425 0.00645731 -0.05735620 0.</description>
