##Geoffrey Thompson's Home Page

This is a rather primitive professional web page, but I needed something functional in a hurry.

I'm a graduate student in the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University. 
My interests are statistical computing, statistical image compression, statistical image processing, clustering, and big data.
I have a BA in mathematics from the University of Chicago and an MS in mathematics (actuarial science) from Roosevelt University.

I suppose a fuller, up-to-date CV is available by request.

My `iastate edu` e-mail address is `gzt`. I can also be reached at my old `uchicago edu` e-mail address which is also `gzt`.

## Links to software I like to use that you might find helpful and I think you should use if you aren't doing something better
* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) The One True Editor - comes with ESS and AucTeX support, which are very handy for doing statistics and writing up everything. knitr is not as well integrated as R Studio, though. Org Mode is supposed to be good, but I haven't started it.
* [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com) is mostly for when I want to do a lot of knitr-ing or exploring graphics, otherwise I use Emacs + ESS.
Handy for organizing projects, integrating with git, building things if you haven't figured out that part of Emacs, too.
* [R](http://www.r-project.com) I presume you already have R.
* [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) makes converting text file formats from one to the other very easy. 
The killer point of pandoc is that it can make making HTML5 slides with MathJAX really easy from simple markdown source. Which knitr can make from R Markdown source. You might need to use slidify, too. 
* [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is incredibly useful for people who are writing reports and using R. You don't even need to know TeX,
you can do it in markdown, which is like commenting [reddit](http://reddit.com), essentially. 
* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) is a graphics package for R and is one of the better things about R. 
* [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) is, in one sense, really great software, but in another, really terrible, but is definitely necessary.
