      <p>I haven&rsquo;t successfully published a post in a while but I finally fixed my web-log
and pushed out some old posts today. I had several issues (putting notes here so I can fix again later):</p>
<ol>
<li>A recent issue, but R Studio was not working on my main computer (Fedora with XFCE).
I often use Emacs+ESS, but for things like the <code>blogdown</code>, it is just easier to use
R Studio and its add-ins. Apparently it is now best practice to install from the
fedora repositories and run <code>dnf install rstudio-desktop</code>. I had, in the past, installed
directly from the R Studio provided rpm.</li>
<li>I basically had to restart the web-log &ndash; download the repositories and start working again from there.
Usually this is fine, but I&rsquo;m doing this an awkward way which isn&rsquo;t recommended anymore: building locally,
then having <code>public/</code> as a submodule which my <code>gzt.github.io</code> page points at. Here are,
I think, the steps I used to fix this. First, clone the blog site. Second, remove the <code>public</code> directory.
Third, run <code>git submodule update --recursive --remote</code>. Fourth, change to the <code>public</code> directory, verify it has what you want (say, run <code>git remote -v</code> and <code>git status</code>), and do something like <code>git checkout master</code> (this is so old I still called the main branch <code>master</code> and haven&rsquo;t gotten around to changing it). Then you should be ready to rock and/or roll.</li>
<li>My about page and such are horribly out of date! I have to change some things before I updated anything.</li>
</ol>
<p>What finally got me to fix #2? My time with Indiana University as a visiting assistant professor is ending and I am open to new opportunities now, which means I should probably have a more up-to-date web presence.</p>
